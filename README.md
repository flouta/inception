## What is Docker?

Docker is an open-source project that simplifies software development with containers. Containers are self-contained packages of software that can be executed independently. They include everything needed to run the software. Docker works on both Windows and Linux systems and can even run within a virtual machine if needed. Its main purpose is to enable the execution of microservice applications in a distributed architecture.

Unlike virtual machines that abstract the entire hardware server, Docker abstracts the operating system kernel. This approach provides advantages such as application portability, infrastructure separation, and self-contained microservices. In summary, Docker offers a faster and lightweight alternative to virtualization by focusing on the essentials needed to run software effectively.
